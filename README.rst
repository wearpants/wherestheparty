Mirror Party
*******************

Mirror Party is a scalable, censorship-resistant mirror network for the web. It aims to make mirroring more accessible for both clients and hosts, allowing several orders of magnitude greater participation. Mirror Party is different from previous mirroring efforts because it works entirely with software users already have - *no* additional packages need to be installed for either clients or hosts.

Mirror Party consists of software tools for building mirror networks and a website for matching content with volunteer hosts. It operates by using JavaScript in the browser to reconstruct the namespace that is a website from content hosted on multiple servers.
